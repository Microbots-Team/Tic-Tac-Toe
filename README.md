# ❌⭕ XO – Interactive Physical Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## 💡 Project Overview
**XO** is an interactive physical **Tic-Tac-Toe (XO) game** that allows a player to compete against the computer on a **real-world game board**.  
The system detects the player's move using **Hall sensors** that identify the placement of **magnetized pieces**.  
Once a move is made, the computer analyzes the board through the backend logic and automatically responds with its own move, creating an engaging blend of **physical gameplay** and **digital intelligence**.

The goal of this project is to merge tangible interaction with digital processing — offering a fun, smart, and responsive gaming experience.

## ⚙️ Components Used
- **Arduino Mega** – serves as the main microcontroller for input processing  
- **Hall Sensors** – detect the magnetic pieces’ positions on the board  
- **Magnetized Game Pieces** – enable sensor detection when placed  
- **Display / Screen (optional)** – shows the digital game state and system response

## 💻 Software & Tools Used
- **React JS** – for building the user interface  
- **Flask** – for backend game logic and move generation  
- **Arduino IDE** – for programming and communicating with the microcontroller
